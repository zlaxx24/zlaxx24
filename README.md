## üí´ About Me:
Hi üëã, I'm Ant√≥nio Silva, a junior Full Stack developer from Portugal
<br><br>I am passionate about designing and building software applications and in my free time, I love solving complex logic problems as well as puzzles, which has helped me to develop strong analytical and critical thinking skills. Although I am new to IT, I am highly motivated and committed to building a successful career in this field.<br><br>On another hand, recently, I completed a 14-week intensive immersive Full Stack developer bootcamp, where I gained valuable experience and knowledge in a range of technologies, such as Java, Spring, Hibernate, mySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, among others.<br><br>I am committed to writing clean and maintainable code! üòÑ
